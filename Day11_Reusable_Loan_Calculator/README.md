## 🌍 Problem Statement

Many Nigerian SMEs borrow from microfinance banks or cooperatives but calculate repayments manually using paper, calculators, or Excel. This leads to:

- Mistakes in principal or interest calculation  
- Delays in repayment planning  
- Confusion when managing multiple loans  

Business owners often lack a simple, reusable tool to:

- Quickly simulate repayment scenarios  
- Track multiple loans at once

Accurate repayment planning improves financial literacy and reduces defaults—critical for SMEs, which are Africa’s economic backbone.
