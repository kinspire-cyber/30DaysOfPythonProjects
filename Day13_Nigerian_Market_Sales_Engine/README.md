## 🌍 Problem Background (African / Nigerian Context)

In popular Nigerian markets such as:

- Balogun (Lagos)
- Ariaria (Aba)
- Wuse (Abuja)
- Ogbete (Enugu)
- Bodija (Ibadan)

Traders often:
- Record daily sales manually
- Store data as rough lists
- Rely on intuition rather than insights

There is **no quick way** to:
- Identify profitable days
- Spot poor-performing days
- Apply charges or deductions
- Summarize performance instantly

## ❗ The Real-World Problem

Most traders and SMEs:
- Waste time looping through data manually
- Cannot quickly analyze patterns
- Miss opportunities for better decisions

**Fast insights = survival** in the informal economy.
