# Nigeria Cooperative Loan Analytics Engine

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Nigeria Cooperative Loan Analytics Engine** is a Python-based project that demonstrates how **Higher Order Functions** can be used to analyze financial data in cooperative societies and microfinance groups.

Many cooperative societies across Nigeria and Africa still rely on manual record-keeping or spreadsheets, which makes it difficult to:

- Track total contributions
- Identify loan defaulters
- Calculate outstanding balances with interest
- Generate meaningful financial insights

This project shows how Python can automate these tasks efficiently using functional programming techniques.

## 🌍 Problem Statement (African Context)

In many African communities:

- Members contribute weekly or monthly
- Loans are issued to members
- Repayments are tracked manually

### Challenges
- Manual calculations are error-prone  
- Hard to identify defaulters quickly  
- Difficult to apply interest and penalties dynamically  
- Limited access to data-driven insights  

### Solution
Use **Python Higher Order Functions** to process cooperative data cleanly, efficiently, and scalably.
