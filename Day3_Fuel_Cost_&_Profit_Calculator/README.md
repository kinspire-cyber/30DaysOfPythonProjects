# Day 3 – Operators
## Fuel Cost & Profit Calculator for Nigerian Transporters

### 🌍 Problem Background (Nigerian Context)

In Nigeria, fuel price fluctuations directly affect:
- Okada riders
- Keke (tricycle) operators
- Taxi & ride-hailing drivers
- Small logistics/delivery businesses

Most operators don't calculate:
- Daily fuel cost
- Cost per trip
- Real profit after fuel

**They guess — and many run at a loss without knowing.**

### 👥 Who This Project Helps

- Okada & Keke riders
- Bolt/Uber drivers
- Dispatch riders
- Small transport SMEs
- Students learning real-world Python

### ❗ Why This Problem Matters in Africa

- Fuel is a major cost driver in African transport
- Rising fuel prices affect food, logistics, and inflation
- Financial literacy at micro-business level is very low
- Simple tools can immediately improve income decisions

### 🧠 Python Concepts & Tools Used (Day 3 Focus)

#### Core Operators
- **Arithmetic operators**: `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` `//` `**`
- **Assignment operators**: `=` `+=` `-=`
- **Comparison operators**: `>` `<` `>=` `<=` `==`
- **Logical operators**: `and`, `or`

#### Other Basics
- `input()`
- `print()`
- Type conversion: `int()`, `float()`

### ⚙️ Core Features

- Collect daily transport data
- Calculate:
  - Total fuel cost
  - Cost per trip
  - Total revenue
  - Net profit or loss
