# 🌾 Farm Produce Market Price Tracker  
**Day 5 – Python Lists Project**

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Farm Produce Market Price Tracker** is a beginner-friendly Python project designed to help farmers and small produce traders in **Nigeria and across Africa** track and understand daily market prices of farm produce.

This project demonstrates how **Python lists** can be used to store, analyze, and display simple market price data — empowering farmers with **price awareness and negotiation power**.

## 🌍 Problem Statement
Across Nigeria and Africa:

- Farmers sell produce such as **yam, maize, rice, pepper, and tomatoes**
- Prices fluctuate by:
  - Market
  - Season
  - Day
- Many farmers:
  - Do not record prices
  - Accept any price buyers offer
  - Lack data to negotiate better

👉 **Information asymmetry keeps farmers poor.**

Even basic price tracking can significantly improve farmers’ income.

## 🇳🇬 African & Nigerian Agricultural Context
- Agriculture employs **60%+ of Africans**
- Most farmers are **smallholder farmers**
- Many digital tools ignore grassroots realities
- Simple data tools can unlock **market intelligence**

📊 **Lists are the first step toward data-driven farming.**
