# Transport Route & Fare Reference System (Nigeria)

## 🌍 Problem Statement

In Nigerian cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt, daily commuters face inconsistencies in public transport fares:

- Common routes exist:  
  - Ojota → Yaba  
  - CMS → Lekki  
  - Wuse → Garki  

- Fares are known but often manipulated by drivers  
- Passengers lack a fixed reference for routes and fares  
- This leads to disputes, unfair pricing, and lack of transparency  

❗ **The Real-World Problem:**  
Passengers often have no fixed fare reference, no knowledge of official routes, and little confidence to challenge overcharging. Drivers exploit these information gaps.

## 👥 Who This Project Helps

- Daily commuters  
- Students  
- Civil servants  
- Transport unions (for reference data)  
- Smart city initiatives  

## 🌍 Why This Problem Matters in Africa

- Transport costs affect work attendance, school access, and economic productivity  
- Informal transport dominates African cities  
- Immutable reference data builds trust between commuters and transport operators  

## ⚙️ Core Features

- Store fixed transport routes  
- Store fixed base fares  
- Display available routes  
- Show fare per route  
- Prevent accidental modification of data  

## 🧠 Python Concepts Covered (Day 6)

- Tuples  
- Tuple indexing  
- Nested tuples  
- Tuple unpacking  
- `len()` function  
- Clean printing  

**Why tuples?**  
Routes and fares should remain immutable to avoid accidental changes.
