# Unique Student ID Validator for Nigerian Schools 🇳🇬

**Day 7 – Python Sets Project**

## 📌 Project Overview

In many Nigerian schools, student records are often stored manually or entered without proper validation. This leads to **duplicate student IDs**, repeated names, and incorrect roll numbers.

This project uses **Python Sets** to automatically detect and remove duplicate student IDs, helping schools maintain **accurate, fair, and reliable records**.

## 🌍 Problem Background (Nigerian Context)

In Nigerian schools:

- Student data is often **messy**
- Duplicate IDs are common
- Manual checking wastes time

### Consequences of Duplicate IDs
- Exam result errors
- Attendance confusion
- Incorrect reports
- Potential fraud

A simple Python-based solution can significantly reduce human error and administrative stress.

## ❗ The Real-World Problem

Schools often lack:
- Automatic duplicate detection
- Student ID uniqueness validation
- Quick reporting tools for errors

Duplicate IDs can affect **hundreds or thousands of students**, especially during examinations.
