# 🇳🇬 Nigerian SME Loan & Repayment Tracker

## 📌 Project Title  
**Nigerian SME Loan & Repayment Tracker**

## 🌍 Problem Background (Nigerian / African Context)

Across Nigeria, many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) collect loans from:

- Cooperative societies  
- Microfinance banks  
- Thrift groups (ajo / esusu)  

However, loan records are often kept using:

- Paper notebooks  
- WhatsApp messages  
- Human memory 😬  

As a result, business owners often forget:

- Who borrowed money  
- How much has been repaid  
- Outstanding balances  

This leads to conflicts, financial losses, and sometimes business failure.
