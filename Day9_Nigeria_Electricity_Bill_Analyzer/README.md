# 🇳🇬 Nigerian Electricity Bill Analyzer (PHCN / DisCos)

**Day 9 – Conditionals (Python Project)**

A simple Python-based tool that helps Nigerian electricity consumers understand, analyze, and evaluate their monthly electricity bills using conditional logic.

## 🌍 Problem Background (Nigerian Context)

In Nigeria, most households and businesses receive monthly electricity bills from PHCN or Distribution Companies (DisCos). These bills are often:

- Difficult to understand  
- Highly variable month-to-month  
- Influenced by multiple tariff categories and extra charges  

As a result, many consumers struggle to:
- Understand their actual electricity consumption  
- Verify if they are being overbilled  
- Track and compare usage across months  

This project addresses these challenges with a simple, beginner-friendly Python solution.

## 🧠 Python Concepts & Tools Used (Day 9 Focus)

This project reinforces core Python conditional logic concepts:

- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements  
- Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`)  
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`)  
- Nested conditions  
- Dynamic output using `print()`
